# Auto-Decoder

Applications: noise reduction, missing measurement completions, fault detections





The idea goes back to at least work 

[Reducing data dimensionality through optimizing neural network inputs]()

> simultaneously optimizes the latent vectors assigned to each data point and the decoder weights through back-propagation.





Similar approach 

[An input-training neural network approach for gross error detection and sensor replacement]()

[Combined input training and radial basis function neural networks based nonlinear principal components analysis model applied for process monitoring]()

[Dimensionality reduction with input training neural network and its application in chemical process modelling.]()





recent work apply deep architectures

[Optimizing the latent space of generative networks]()

[High resolution shape completion using deep neural networks for global structure and local geometry inference]()
