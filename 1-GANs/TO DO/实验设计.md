Synthetic Dataset

> a toy 2D mixture of Gaussians dataset
>
> Mode collapse can be accurately measured on synthetic datasets, since the true distribution and its modes are known.
>
> Who uses this experiment: [2], [3], 

In this section, we compare our method on two synthetic datasets of increasing difficulty: a mixture of eight 2D Gaussian distributions arranged in <u>a ring</u>, a mixture of twenty-five 2D Gaussian distributions arranged in <u>a grid</u>. This experiment follows [2,3]



Face

dataset: 

[LFW](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) Labeled Faces in the Wild

Celeb-A: 202599

Multi-PIE: is the largest database for evaluating face recognition under pose, illumination, and expression variations in the controlled setting

## Natural Scene

- [Transient Attribute Database](Transient attributes for high-level understanding and editing of outdoor scenes)

  > It contains 8,571 scene images with 40 attributes in 5 categories including lighting (e.g., “bright”), weather (e.g., “cloudy”) , seasons (e.g., “winter”), subjective impressions (e.g., “beautiful”), and additional attributes (e.g., “dirty”). Each attribute is annotated with a real-valued score between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates absence of the attribute.
