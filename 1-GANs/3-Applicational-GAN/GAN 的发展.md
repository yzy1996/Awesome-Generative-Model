GAN 的发展



**The resolution and quality:**

Progressive growing of GANs for improved quality, stability, and variation

Spectral normalization for generative adversarial networks

Large scale GAN training for high fidelity natural image synthesis



**Understanding of synthesis process**

1. generator perspective
