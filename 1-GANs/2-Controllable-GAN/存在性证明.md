2015 Radford et al. find GAN latent space processes semantically meaningful vector space arithmetic

Some work has observed the vector arithmetic property

Latent space of GANs is generally treated as Riemannian manifold

Prior work focused on exploring how to make the output image vary smoothly from one synthesis to another through interpolation in the latent space, regardless of whether the image is semantically controllable

**when linearly interpolating two latent codes z1 and z2, the appearance of the corresponding synthesis changes continuously, It implicitly means that the semantics contained in the image also change gradually**
