## Conditioned Generation

Diffusion Models Beat GANs on Image Synthesis

Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance





## Scale up Generation Resolution and Quality

Cascaded Diffusion Models for High Fidelity Image Generation

use a pipeline of multiple diffusion models at increasing resolutions

They found the most effective noise is to apply Gaussian noise at low resolution and Gaussian blur at high resolution.
