> Summary

Transfer the knowledge in **dense pose recognition for humans** to other classes (such as animals).

By model for human is geometrically aligned to humans



canonical mapping



> Problem setting

existing annotated data 

additional unlabeled images and videos 

restrict the attention to chimpanzees. but the model can generalize to other classes 





> Training process
