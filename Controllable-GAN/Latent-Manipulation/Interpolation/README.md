## Introduction

interpolation or extrapolation



why do we care about:

faithful data interpolation can be seen as a measure of the generalisation capacity of the a learning system (model + latent space)



The task of data interpolation is to extra new samples between known data samples.



The interpolation often leads to artifacts or produce unrealistic results during reconstruction.

This is because the naively interpolated latent vectors deviate from the data manifold.



We can regard the interpolate manifold as S1

we hope is consistent with the training images 

the manifold is smooth and locally convex



so we need to consider the geometry and shape of the manifold
